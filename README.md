This was the second project of the semester for Introduction to Data Science course (DATS 6101) under GWU's Data Science master's program.

We analyzed data from a Pew Research Center online survey about climate change in order to examine attitudes about global warming in the U.S. and across the world.

The questions mapped for this visualization are:

In your view, is global climate change a very serious problem, somewhat serious, not too serious or not a problem?

Do you think global climate change is harming people around the world now, will harm people in the next few years, will not harm people for many years or will never harm people?
